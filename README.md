# Training Laravel

* Include `docker-compose.yml` to this repository.
* Everyone launch server with `docker-compose up` on local device if we get source code from this repository.
* Everyone find out result page on local device web browser.
* Use `PHP7`, `Laravel`, `Nginx`, `MySQL`.
* Add the necessary information to the `README.md`. The testers can launch the docker locally and describe it so that it can be viewed in a browser.

* The design of the deliverables does not matter, but those that are too rough are NG. You can use any JS & CSS framework you like.
* Data should be persistent. The final data should be displayed even if it is accessed from another device.
* Use English instead of Japanese in the UI.
